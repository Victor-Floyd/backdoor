# Installing, Using, and Blocking a Malware-based Backdoor

In this lab, I will disable Windows Defender, leaving a server vulnerable. 
I'll then simulate the accidental installation of malware and view the changes. 
Next I'll take on the role of a pen tester or hacker, and determine whether the malware was installed based on open network ports. 
I'll then connect to the infected server, proving I have the ability to exploit it. 
Finally, in the role of security administrator, I will remove the malware.

â€¢ Disable Windows Defender protection, leaving the server vulnerable to malware. <br/> <br/>
